# Capstone Project

This application is part of a wider application to connect local natives to a place, or frequent travelers, to construct top 10 lists (or shorter), so that tourists coming in from out of town will be able to view suggestions and get information about a trip for their type of travel. Some couples want adventurous and outdoors, some want romantic and intimate. This application will allow people to both submit and search for places that are for specific cities and specific travel goals (i.e. family fun/romance/outdoors). This was made for a capstone project for a class I'm in.
